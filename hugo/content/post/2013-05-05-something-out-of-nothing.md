Sometimes when working with [abominable][1] [APIs][2], [hugely complex build 
systems][3], abysmally useless error messages or things with [too much damn 
magic][4], I forget why I enjoy programming. Every once in a while though, 
something like the leading quote of this post will nudge me back in the right 
direction.

Back in high school, my Computer Science teacher would occasionally find some 
extra work for me to do to keep me occupied. One of the first things he showed 
me was [Conway's Game of Life][7].

I remember writing my first copy of it in Dev C++ on Windows XP on the top floor 
of my high school. Seeing the `@`'s and `.`'s morph and move around in my little 
windowed `cmd.exe` window on my yellow-stained-white 17" CRT monitor perfectly 
embodies why I love programming.

The ability to start with an empty `main.cpp` and wind up with this little 
digital organism that evolves in a predictable but nonetheless mesmerizing 
pattern is gratifying in ways difficult to explain to anyone who's never done 
it.

For some reason, creating something out of nothing has always given me a thrill 
far beyond the gratification of contributing to a larger whole. Maybe it's the 
feeling of accomplishment provided by being able to explain how the whole thing 
works.  Maybe it's writing more logic than glue. Maybe it's just the fact 
there's some truth to the phrase "hell is other people's code", or perhaps I'm 
just too immature to feel as good about working with others' code.

It's these tiny projects I hacked together somewhere within a day to a week that 
give me the greatest gratification. It applies especially well to projects that 
I did to learn something. My [Fifteen Puzzle][8] and [Propositional Logic Truth 
Table Generator][9] are two other examples. Small, self-contained, visually 
interactive projects that I wrote every single line for.

None of these things are products. Only the truth table generator is even 
_mildly_ useful. But damned if I didn't have a lot of fun *playing* with them.

For some reason or other, I've felt the need to spend more time working on 
"useful" things in my free time as time has gone on. I need to get back to 
building useless somethings out of nothings. I need to re-infect myself with the 
computer disease.
