This post marks the birth of yet another website I will inevitably use for about a year then run out of time and stop updating. Hopefully this one won't get eaten by a worm like the last one though. Stupid obscure javascript vulnerability.

The virus that owned the old site (along with every other index.* on my webspace) was a variant of the Gumblar.cn virus
<a href="http://blog.unmaskparasites.com/2009/05/07/gumblar-cn-exploit-12-facts-about-this-injected-script/">http://blog.unmaskparasites.com/2009/05/07/gumblar-cn-exploit-12-facts-about-this-injected-script/</a>

It infected my computer just by visiting a site, found my stored ftp credentials from FileZilla (teaches me not to store my passwords), logged into my webspace and proceeded to modify any index.* file. Very evil, very clever virus. Right on that tipping point between me being impressed and me being horrified.
