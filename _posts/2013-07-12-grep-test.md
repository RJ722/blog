I'll occasionally see code that attempts to use clever mechanisms to reduce code 
duplication or be terser by using metaprogramming or string concatenation or any 
number of other mechanisms to [DRY][0] up code.

But sometimes it impedes maintainability in ways that are not immediately 
obvious. When working in any language, but particularly dynamic languages such 
as Python, JavaScript, or Ruby, `grep` or one of its variants (`ack`, `git 
grep`, etc.) is an essential tool for figuring out where and how a class, 
function, module, or variable is used. Here I propose a simple test, that if 
failed, is sufficient to reject a piece of code under review. (You are 
performing code reviews, right?)

**The Grep Test: _If any code declares or makes use of a function, class, 
module, or variable that cannot be located by grepping for its full identifying 
token, it fails the Grep Test._**

By "full identifying token", I mean that if I search for `inverseTransform`, I 
expect to find every declaration or invocation of any method named 
`inverseTransform`.  I would not expect to be able to find every use of the 
`inverseTransform` method of `Node` by grepping for `Node.inverseTransform`, 
since that isn't a single token.

**EDIT**: Added a section on Compromises in response to some of the [discussion 
on HN][5].

# Counterexamples

## Dynamic Declaration

Here are a few examples of code that would fail the Grep Test because of dynamically declared functions.

### JavaScript: dynamic function declarations

    lang:javascript

    var Ray = function(position, direction) {
      this.position = position;
      this.direction = direction;
    };

    ["position", "direction"].forEach(function(property) {
      var getterName = "get" + property.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + property.substr(1);
      Ray.prototype[getterName] = function() {
        return this[property];
      };
    });

    var ray = new Ray([0, 0], [1, 1]);
    console.log(ray.getPosition());
    console.log(ray.getDirection());

Fails because grepping for `getPosition` won't find me the function definition.

### Ruby: `method_missing`

    lang:ruby

    class Ray
      attr_accessor :position, :direction

      def initialize(position, direction)
        @position = position
        @direction = direction
      end

      def method_missing(m, *args, &block)
        if m.to_s =~ /^negative_(\w+)$/
          case $1
            when "position"
              [  -@position[0],  -@position[1] ]
            when "direction"
              [ -@direction[0], -@direction[1] ]
          end
        else
          super
        end
      end
    end

    ray = Ray.new([1, 2], [3, 4])
    puts ray.position.inspect
    puts ray.direction.inspect
    puts ray.negative_position.inspect
    puts ray.negative_direction.inspect

Fails the test because grepping for `negative_position` won't find me the 
function definition.

### Python: `__getattr__`

    lang:python

    import re

    class Ray(object):
        def __init__(self, position, direction):
            self.position = position
            self.direction = direction

        def __getattr__(self, name):
            pat = re.compile('^(\w+)_is_zero$')
            if pat.match(name):
                prop = pat.findall(name)[0]
                if prop == 'position':
                    return self.position[0] == 0 and self.position[1] == 0
                elif prop == 'direction':
                    return self.direction[0] == 0 and self.direction[1] == 0

            raise AttributeError

    ray = Ray([0, 0], [1, 1])
    print ray.position
    print ray.direction
    print ray.position_is_zero
    print ray.direction_is_zero

Fails the test because grepping for `position_is_zero` won't find me the 
function definition.

## Dynamic Invocation

Here's an example that would fail the Grep Test due to dynamic invocation:

Let's say we have a form:

    lang:html

    <form class="login">
        Username: <input name="username" />
        Password: <input name="password" />
        <input type="submit" />
    </form>

And we want to update a model based on the values of these fields when the form 
is submitted:

    lang:javascript

    var User = function() {};

    User.prototype.getUsername = function() {
      return this._username;
    };

    User.prototype.setUsername = function(username) {
      this._username = username;
    };

    User.prototype.getPassword = function() {
      return this._password;
    }

    User.prototype.setPassword = function(password) {
      this._password = password;
    };

    $("form.login").submit(function(ev) {
      ev.preventDefault();
      var fields = $(this).serializeArray();
      var user = new User();
      $(fields).each(function(i, field) {
        var capName = field.name.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + field.name.substr(1);
        var value = field.value;
        user["set" + capName](value);
        console.log(user["get" + capName]());
      });
      console.log(user);
    });

Fails the test because grepping for `getUsername` won't find the invocation in 
the submit callback.

# Compromises

So should we throw out dynamic code generation wholesale? No. We just have to be 
careful to preserve the whole identifiers our fellow developers are likely to be 
looking for.

My preferred solution to all of the above counterexamples is to just avoid 
dynamic declaration and invocation completely, but there is certainly a scale at 
which this becomes a pain and metaprogramming because a pragmatic option.

## Avoiding String Manipulation

One option is to provide slightly more information while still dynamically 
generating functions.

    lang:javascript

    [
      {attr: "position", fn: "getPosition"},
      {attr: "direction", fn: "getDirection"}
    ].forEach(function(property) {
      Ray.prototype[property.fn] = function() {
        return this[property.attr];
      };
    });

Now both `position` and `getPosition` remain greppable while still avoiding 
duplicating any common functionality you may have for these functions.

## Using Comments

Another similar option for retaining dynamic methods while maintaining 
greppability is to simple add the tokens in the comments.

    lang:javascript

    // Generates the following methods for Ray:
    //  - getPosition
    //  - getDirection
    ["position", "direction"].forEach(function(property) {
      var getterName = "get" + property.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + property.substr(1);
      Ray.prototype[getterName] = function() {
        return this[property];
      };
    });

While I frankly still find this code more difficult to follow than the first 
compromise or avoiding dynamic declaration altogether, I'd still appreciate 
these comments when navigating a codebase.

# Why is this Important?

When working with dynamic code, it's an incredible boon to productivity to be 
able to quickly locate the definition of functions so you can build a complete
mental context about what's going on. Two common tools for doing this are `grep` 
and `ctags`, both of which require the entire identifier be written out at the 
declaration site. (For the vim users reading this, you should really know about 
using [ctags in vim][1].) Dynamic declaration ruins this.

When modifying existing code, *especially* without good test coverage, 
**especially** when *refactoring* code without good test coverage, it's 
essential to be able to find all the usages of a given class or function. Here, 
`grep` is my tool of choice. Dynamic invocation ruins this. If you have code 
breaking the Grep Test, refactoring becomes a nightmare. I've deleted code I 
thought was unused far too many times because of this.

As a broad generalization, I would say dynamic declaration is occasionally worth 
the tradeoff, but dynamic invocation is almost never worthwhile.

# A Comment on Frameworks

I'm sure by this point, a few of you have thought "Hey, but Rails fails the Grep 
Test!". This is absolutely true, most notable due to the [dynamic `find_by_*` 
finders][2], and the [dynamic `*_path` URL path generators][3].

I personally remember tripping over trying to find these in the documentation 
when I was learning Rails, so I'm not a huge fan of these. That said, there is 
an argument for the beautiful sugar this provides. If you're going to do stuff 
like this, use it sparingly and make sure it's a well known convention used 
everywhere.
