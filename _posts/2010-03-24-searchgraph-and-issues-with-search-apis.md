Google
-Estimated result count is wrong (comparison between results from api & screen scraping
-Screen scraping against TOS, eventually results in captcha

Bing
-Results vary wildly between geographical locations: "http://www.bing.com/search?q=%22I%20have%203%20legs%22"
-Look at difference between Canada and the US

Yahoo
-Estimated result count is wrong, however the trend is more consistent and logical than it is with the google API
