Vim is a terminal & GUI editor widely used by programmers. Reading upper year SE blogs, it's obvious that I'm not the only one that loves Vim (Thor likes it, so you know it's good.)

If you're interesting in trying to learn a (frighteningly) powerful editor, all the information about installing this cross-platform editor is here: <a href="http://www.vim.org/">http://www.vim.org/</a>

It should come along with a companion tool called vimtutor, which is an interactive way of learning how to use the editor. Vim isn't intuitive to people who have only used GUI based editors, so you'll want to go through that. Alternatively (or in addition), there's a great free book called "A Byte of Vim" which you can find here: <a href="http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Vim">http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Vim</a>.

Tonight I spent a little while fiddling around with my vimrc to change a few hotkeys and set up multilanguage support for quick compilation. I have it set up so you have to hit &lt;F2&gt; then enter (&lt;CR&gt; is carriage return and is roughly equivalent to &lt;ENTER&gt; in the context of vim) because I occasionally like to pipe the output to less in the event I get massive amounts of errors. I want to take a look at the compiler plugin for vim, which apparently will select the line where my error is like other IDEs do.

In any case, you can see my vimrc here: <a href="http://github.com/phleet/phleet.github.com/blob/master/dotfiles/.vimrc">Vimrc @ Github</a>
