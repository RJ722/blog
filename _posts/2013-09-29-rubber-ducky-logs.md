I hate debugging. Anyone that's worked at a desk near mine has likely witnessed 
my debugging cycle of rage, insight, disbelief, and existential despair. The end 
condition of this cycle is either success or reluctant resignation, with the 
occasional therapeutic Reddit break (cute animals are an emotional force to be 
reckoned with).

From the years I've spent writing and debugging code, I can only really offer a 
few pieces of general advice.

1. **Confirm your assumptions**. Is this function really getting called?  Do I 
   really understand the documented behaviour of the library? Do I really 
   understand the language constructs I'm using? Does the library actually do 
   what it says it does?
2. **Get more information**. Log _everything_. The presence and order of your 
   logs are invaluable for seeing what's happening. If they're too noisy, be 
   intelligent with your logs. Format them hierarchically, output an image, 
   output something machine readable so you can manipulate it. My most 
   ridiculous example of this came from debugging a raytracer, where I output 
   coordinates then [plotted the rays manually in Blender][8].
3. **Make a minimal test case**. Try to remove as many variables as you possibly 
   can while still demonstrating the bug. Rule out as many possible causes as 
   possible by deleting modules, files, and lines of code. Try to reproduce the 
   bug outside your codebase entirely. Open source maintainers will love you, 
   and you now have something you can dump on IRC.
4. **Know when to leave your desk**. It hurts programmers to leave their desk 
   when they've got a full context on a problem, but sometimes you need to step 
   away and let it simmer in the back of your head for a while.
5. **Use a Rubber Ducky.**

# Rubber Ducky Logs

At a previous job, I found myself repeatedly running into brick walls of bugs 
where I would run around in circles trying to locate the cause. My coworkers 
were helpful when available, but I was wary of breaking their [flow][0], and 
occasionally I'd be debugging late into the night when nobody else was around.

As a means of maintaining sanity, and explaining why what should have been a 
simple change took me 2 days, I started writing what I'll now lovingly call 
"Rubber Ducky Logs".

Rubber ducky logs are simple text files I keep around and edit in vim that 
document my progress working through a bug. Here's an excerpt from one of my 
most recent logs:

    Finally got tests that load the entire shared package running in the 
    browser,
    and now phantomjs is choking.

        TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'RegExp.prototype.test.bind(
            /^(data|aria)-[a-z_][a-z\d_.\-]*$/
        )')

    Very confused as to how this happens in phantom, but not chrome. Different
    versions of V8? Wtf? (Postmortem note: phantom does not use V8, I was 
    totally wrong.)

    Changing it to this seems to fix the problem:

        isCustomAttribute: function(name) {
            return /^(data|aria)-[a-z_][a-z\d_.\-]*$/.test(name);
        },

    But now I'm getting failures that I don't see in the browser.

        Error: Load timeout for modules: package!dashboard.js_unnormalized2,package!dashboard.js,package!profile.js,template!profile.profile-tab-achievements

        Timeout: tests did not start. This may be because of errors on the page.

    It seems to choke on

        require("package!dashboard.js");

    shared.js and tasks.js both load just fine.

    it chokes on profile.js

    dashboard.js without the dependency on profile.js seems to work, so that
    suggests the problem is in profile.js

The added benefit of having these logs is that I can reference them again when a 
coworker or I runs into similar problems.

# A Heinous Bug

The motivation for this post came from debugging a particularly nasty bug where 
my original expectation of what was causing problems and the actual cause were 
surprisingly far apart.

My current task is to build client-side testing infrastructure. Tests are loaded 
using [RequireJS][3], and are written against the [Mocha][4] testing framework. 
The tests can either be run in-browser for debugging, or headlessly in 
[phantomjs][4]. For integration with existing tooling, the test runners are 
written in python.

After addressing a minor problem in [react.js][6] that was causing it to fail 
loading in phantom, I started seeing another problem that I couldn't reproduce 
in chrome.

    Error: Load timeout for modules: 
    package!dashboard.js_unnormalized2,package!dashboard.js,package!profile.js,template!profile.profile-tab-achievements
    http://requirejs.org/docs/errors.html#timeout
    http://localhost:1235/third_party/javascript-khansrc/requirejs/require.js : 138
    http://localhost:1235/third_party/javascript-khansrc/requirejs/require.js : 536
    http://localhost:1235/third_party/javascript-khansrc/requirejs/require.js : 691
    http://localhost:1235/third_party/javascript-khansrc/requirejs/require.js : 710
    Timeout: tests did not start. This may be because of errors on the page.

At Khan Academy, static assets are bundled together in "packages" (not CommonJS 
or node packages). I made a RequireJS loader plugin to load full packages 
altogether, and it appeared to be timing out.  I tried switching which packages 
were being loaded and narrowed it down to a package called `profile.js`.

At this point, I tried narrowing it down further to a specific file in the 
`profile.js` package. I systematically removed files and found that if I remove 
the last 8 files in the package, the error disappeared.

"Great!", I thought, "I've narrowed down the problem!". So I tried removing all 
the files in the package *except* the last 8 files, and saw that the error also 
disappeared in that case. Damn.

At that point it's around 2am and I was sitting in a bed in Lyon, France with an 
8am wakeup call, so I decided to call it a night.

My debugging continued on the train from Lyon to Paris, and having left the 
keyboard to think for a while, I remembered that phantomjs is built on webkit, 
not chromium, so it's actually using JavascriptCore, not V8. I tried loading up 
the tests in Safari and see that they run just fine though, so either it's a 
different version of JavascriptCore, or I'm looking at the problem wrong.

I tried a little longer to narrow down the list of files in the package to see 
which combination of files was causing a failure, but it seems almost arbitrary 
which files' removal fixed the problem.

At this point I had a theory: the problem is the sheer number of files, and not 
which files in particular it is. I started wondering how that could be the case, 
and my first two thoughts are [`ulimit`][7] and some limitation on external 
resources on phantom.

Well, it can't be `ulimit` because the number of files I'm opening is way under 
the limit output by ulimit.

    $ ulimit -a
    -t: cpu time (seconds)         unlimited
    -f: file size (blocks)         unlimited
    -d: data seg size (kbytes)     unlimited
    -s: stack size (kbytes)        8192
    -c: core file size (blocks)    0
    -v: address space (kb)         unlimited
    -l: locked-in-memory size (kb) unlimited
    -u: processes                  709
    -n: file descriptors           2560

I made a package that contains 150 JS files that do nothing, and tried loading 
that.  This also exhibits the problem, and only in phantom, so that supports my 
theory.  This also rules out Mocha from being a contributor to the problem.

    ...

I figure I now had enough to make a minimal test case in a separate repository 
that I could bug people on IRC or github issues about, so I made a new git repo 
and tried to bring in only the components I needed. No repro. Damn.

I tried reducing the number of variables within the original repository. I 
discovered I could reproduce using just using jQuery AJAX requests, so that 
rules out RequireJS being a contributor. I also switched to getting `.txt` files 
instead of `.js` files, which repros and ruled out the problem being isolated to 
getting JS files.

I started bringing in more things from the original repo into the isolated one, 
including the python test runners. Suddenly I was able reproduce in the external 
repository.

All the python scripts do are boot a local static server by shelling out to 
`python -mSimpleHTTPServer` and shell out to `phantomjs`. I tried doing these 
two steps myself without using the `subprocess` module in between, and suddenly 
the bug is gone.

But why is this only happening for phantom and not in chrome? Both of them shell 
out to `SimpleHttpServer`. Investigating, I discovered the only difference is 
that the phantom script invokes the web server with `stderr=subprocess.PIPE` to 
silence the output of the server since it reports test results to the console, 
whereas the chrome runner lets the logs pass through to the console since the 
results are viewed in browser.

Googling around with this new kind of problem, I find this: [Subprocess Hanging 
PIPE is your enemy][10].

It turns out that while the number of files was indirectly the cause, the real 
differentiating factor between it previously working in phantom and suddenly not 
was the _size of the server logs_. Once the web server had logged a certain 
amount, it blocked the process completely until the logs were flushed.

Switching from `stderr=subprocess.PIPE` to `stderr=open(os.devnull, 'w+')` fixes 
the problem for good. Good grief.

issue
with RequireJS.*
