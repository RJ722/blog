When I was in High School, I would try to absorb as much about computer science 
as I could from what I saw around me. I started writing competitions like 
[CCC][], [dwite][] and [ECOO-CS][]. I practiced for these competitions using 
[UVa Online Judge][UVa], the [USACO Training Program Gateway] and by reading 
[_The Programming Contest Training Manual_][skiena]. I wrote word game bots and 
learned a lot from hacking challenge sites like [hackquest][] and 
[hackthissite][].

But I also used to [dance][], [draw][], make [abstract 3D stuff][], game and 
[play badminton][] (bear with me &mdash; the part of this that doesn't sound 
like bragging is coming).

When I got to university, I became fully immersed in computer science and 
software. I made the ACM team, started reading [r/programming][] and [Hacker 
News][], started blogging about the code I was writing, started preaching the 
virtues of vim to my classmates and just generally increased the surface area of 
my CS knowledge sponge. This, in itself, was not a bad thing. Some of the things 
I've learned through these methods have been invaluable, but the cost was too 
high.

With the dramatically higher load of schoolwork from uWaterloo's Engineering 
program compared to high school, this influx of new activities meant the 
sacrifice of something. Preparing for interviews and trying to build an online 
presence made it easier to justify dropping off the professionally irrelevant 
things. I stopped drawing, stopped dancing, cut back on badminton and nearly 
stopped gaming. After that, I was entirely immersed in my field with little else 
around me.

I started realizing how bad this had become when I found myself trying to think 
of something to code during my free time. _This is so wrong._ Coding on my own 
time had become this obligation I had to fulfill to maintain my sense of 
reputation and to counter any fear of failing to complete some non-specific goal 
of doing something amazing. Don't get me wrong &mdash; coding on your own time 
is a good idea, but only do it if you're working on something that excites you.

So this seems like a relatively simple problem to fix, right? Just start doing 
the things you used to do. Only one problem.

Motivation
==========

Lack of motivation is the killer of all self-improvement endeavours. Everyone 
has had a thing or two that they commit to doing that trails off. Whether it be 
eating right, going to the gym, keeping in touch with family and friends, or 
quitting smoking, everyone has failed to make or break a habit.

The most common pattern in my failures has been starting something, getting a 
rhythm going and then having one thing throw it off. Your schedule breaks down 
and you can't get back into it. This might be when exams start, when a project 
deadline is coming up or when you get sick. I can always convince myself that 
I'll get back to it later, but I never do.

### Incentives

![Incentives](/images/11-12-28-Incentives.png)

One method to bolster motivation is to use incentives. Self-awarded incentives 
have failed me for two reasons.

1. Internally, I know that I can give myself the reward regardless of whether I 
   achieved my goal.
2. Sometimes I would rather forfeit the incentive than do the work required to 
   get it.

Incentives that are gated by someone else are likely more successful, but if it 
isn't something you can give yourself, then it's probably not something you can 
reasonably ask of from a friend.

### Disincentives

![Disincentives](/images/11-12-28-Disincentives.png)

While self-awarded incentives are limited by what you might give yourself 
anyway, disincentives have no such restrictions. The only problem here is making
sure that the punishment is unavoidable.

Self-imposed disincentives share the issue of convincing yourself that your goal 
was unachievable and abandoning your commitment. Luckily, certain kinds of 
disincentives are not only something you can reasonably ask of your friends, but 
something that some friends will thoroughly enjoy enforcing.

### Schadenfreude

[Schadenfreude][] is a most excellent German word that [@ampersandy][] pointed 
out to me meaning "pleasure derived from the misfortune of others". While 
serious misfortune yields sympathy from our friends &mdash; there are some 
undesired outcomes that are just downright funny. Whether it be someone 
attempting an acrobatic stunt and failing spectacularly or coming to the 
realization that they've just landed on Park Place and Board Walk with hotels in 
the same turn &mdash;
sometimes it's just funny.

The Plan
========

This enjoyment of our friends' misfortunes is the primary motivational tool in 
my plan. The idea is to select a disincentive which your friends will gleefully 
enforce, tell everyone about it, then fight to deprive your friends of that 
sweet, sweet Schadenfreude.

### The Bait

I couldn't think of a suitable motivating punishment, so I crowdsourced it to my 
beloved friends with the following post on Facebook:

![Bait](/images/11-12-28-Bait.png)

### The Restrictions

The bait was followed by a list of restrictions I was imposing on the 
punishment. #5 and up weren't included in the list I gave to my friends, but are 
things I would recommend if you plan to make your own pledge.

1. **It has to only negatively affect me.** This rules out punishments that 
   would hurt my productivity on group projects or at work.
2. **It has to have only short term negative consequences.** It should be sweet 
   sadistic joy for my friends, but shouldn't ruin my career, relationships or 
   skeletal structure.
3. **I can't be morally against the punishment.** While I will do everything I 
   can to avoid suffering the punishment &mdash; I have to be willing to 
   actually go through with it.
4. **It can't be illegal.** This one is pretty self-explanatory.
5. **It can't be charitable.** One option I've seen before is to donate to a 
   charity if you fail your goal. This seems like a poor option because you'll 
   feel good about yourself for donating if you fail and it would make you feel 
   crummy for celebrating the fact that you succeeded and don't have to give to 
   charity.
6. **It has to be all or nothing.** Make success/failure boolean. If you reduce 
   the punishment with every step you make, then you might be alright with 
   bearing the brunt of 5% of the punishment. The last 5% of your trek should be 
   the most motivating &mdash; not the least. The point here is not to make an 
   effort &mdash; the point is to succeed.
7. **It has to be impossible to fail the punishment.** This rules out any 
   punishment that requires a lot of time on the part of the person being 
   punished, such as hours of physical labour or reading of terrible books.

### The Response

I got the following recommendations for punishment upon failure:

* **Post all of the work you did, no matter how unfinished or terrible.** This 
  is a decent suggestion &mdash; but I don't think posting my incomplete stuff 
  would bother me all that much.
* **Every day you don't draw, you have to start a company.**
* **Chinese Water Torture.**
* **Watch a movie with false depictions of programming for each day missed.** 
* **For every day missed, bike a kilometer**.

But the winner was:

* **Get your legs waxed.** This meets all of my criteria, and I _really_ don't 
  want to do this.

### The Pledge

** Starting January 1st, 2012, I will draw for a total of 121 hours before 
11:59pm EST on May 1st, 2012. The accumulated time with be measured by me with 
minute accuracy using a stopwatch. If I fail to complete this goal, I will get 
my legs professionally waxed, and any of my friends who wish to attend will be 
allowed to do so. **
